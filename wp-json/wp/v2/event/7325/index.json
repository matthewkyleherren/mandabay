Later joined by drummer James Goulbourn in 2015, they were completed by Louis Heaps on bass. HIMALAYAS started making their own unique blend of raucous fast- paced rock\u2019n\u2019roll music, which soon went on to earn them an extremely solid fanbase. The four-piece have been cutting their teeth on the live circuit ever since, playing highly-regarded festivals including SXSW and Reading &amp; Leeds Festival, supported the likes of Stereophonics and Manic Street Preachers, and have played sold- out headline shows in London and Cardiff.HIMALAYAS have also racked up over 30 million streams on their 2017 track Thank God I\u2019m Not You, on Spotify alone, where it was also added to several editorial playlists. The single received spins from Radio 1\u2019s from Greg James and Clara Amfo, where it was also Track Of The Week, plus plays from Steve Lamacq on Radio 6. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"}},"event_location":[67],"class_list":["post-7325","event","type-event","status-publish","hentry","event_genre-rock","event_location-drake-underground"],"acf":[],"lang":"en","translations":{"en":7325},"pll_sync_post":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/thedrake.ca\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/event\/7325","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/thedrake.ca\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/event"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/thedrake.ca\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/event"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/thedrake.ca\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=7325"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"event_location","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thedrake.ca\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/event_location?post=7325"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
