It doesn\u2019t matter who you are, where you\u2019ve been, or when you got there. The group\u2019s hybrid of R&amp;B, hip-hop, rock, trap, and alternative is just as inclusive as their core ethos is. The Los Angeles group\u2014Jadagrace and SWIM\u2014architect the kinds of anthems that make you feel like you\u2019re a part of something bigger, emboldening you with bangers in the process. They\u2019re not simply creating music; they\u2019re creating a community. 15 years ago, Jadagrace and SWIM forged a rock-solid friendship as they respectively pursued their dreams. Eventually, they unlocked once-in-a-lifetime chemistry during their time together in grouptherapy, releasing a string of projects, collaborating with Tinashe and Rejjie Snow, and performing to packed houses.

Rallying an ardent audience behind them, generating tens of millions of streams, and receive widespread praise, the duo invite any and all listeners into their circle with their 2025 full-length debut LP, AMERIKA\u2019S NEXT TOP PARTY [Def Jam Recordings]."}},"event_location":[67],"class_list":["post-6128","event","type-event","status-publish","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","event_genre-hip-hop","event_location-drake-underground"],"acf":[],"lang":"en","translations":{"en":6128},"pll_sync_post":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/thedrake.ca\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/event\/6128","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/thedrake.ca\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/event"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/thedrake.ca\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/event"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thedrake.ca\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/6130"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/thedrake.ca\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=6128"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"event_location","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thedrake.ca\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/event_location?post=6128"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
