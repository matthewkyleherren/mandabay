There, living with his dog and surrounded by nature, Casey reconnected with his roots and finished lekkerland, his debut album named after an Afrikaans word meaning \u201csomething pleasing.\u201d Raised in Chesterfield and inspired by early 2000s pop icons, Casey chased fame as a teen, scoring a viral hit with \u201cTrampoline\u201d and landing a record deal\u2014only to realize the pop machine wasn\u2019t for him. Dropped during the pandemic, he returned home and found unexpected success on TikTok, where his funny, diaristic songs earned him millions of fans and a global touring career. Working closely with producer Raffer, Casey built lekkerland as a deeply personal, self-directed project, shaped by friendship, grief, therapy, and real-life stories. Tracks like \u201cNot Ready,\u201d \u201cCaroline,\u201d \u201cBlue Cords,\u201d and \u201cBlood Line\u201d reflect his mix of vulnerability and wit. Now with over 5 million followers, four sold-out tours, and his own management company, Casey is creating a more grounded, inclusive version of the music world\u2014one where he and his fans can be entirely themselves."}},"event_location":[67],"class_list":["post-1963","event","type-event","status-publish","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","event_genre-live-show","event_genre-music","event_location-drake-underground"],"acf":[],"lang":"en","translations":{"en":1963},"pll_sync_post":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/thedrake.ca\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/event\/1963","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/thedrake.ca\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/event"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/thedrake.ca\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/event"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thedrake.ca\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1964"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/thedrake.ca\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1963"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"event_location","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thedrake.ca\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/event_location?post=1963"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
