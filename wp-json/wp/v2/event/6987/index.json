Noel Gallagher has not only championed the young Geordie, but he also produced and played guitar on his track\u2018Where\u2019s My Family Gone\u2019. Pete Doherty is similarly enamoured by Andrew\u2019s flair for creating big anthems from songs which explore hefty social issues; first signing Andrew to his Strap Originals label and then taking him on tour with The Libertines. Andrew Cushin\u2019s songs are full of astute observations and honest meditations about life\u2019s day-to-day tribulations. But despite the weight of the subject matter, his music possesses a tangible sense of hope too. He\u2019s the product of his upbringing Newcastle, and fittingly the city is embracing him as one of their own. His hometown headline shows all rapidly sell- out, including gigs at The Boiler Shop and The Cluny as well as a benefit night for the mental health charity Mind."}},"event_location":[67],"class_list":["post-6987","event","type-event","status-publish","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","event_genre-indie-rock","event_location-drake-underground"],"acf":[],"lang":"en","translations":{"en":6987},"pll_sync_post":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/thedrake.ca\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/event\/6987","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/thedrake.ca\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/event"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/thedrake.ca\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/event"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thedrake.ca\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/6988"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/thedrake.ca\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=6987"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"event_location","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thedrake.ca\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/event_location?post=6987"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
