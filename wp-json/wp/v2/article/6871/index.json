It\u2019s about place, community, and the makers who turn good ingredients into great experiences. From October 23rd to November 16th, restaurants across The County will serve menus inspired by the season, inviting diners to taste new adventures and revisit old favourites. At Drake Devonshire, food isn\u2019t just served \u2014 it tells a tale. For this year\u2019s Countylicious, Executive Chef Amanda Ray has composed a menu that captures autumn in The County, plate by plate. Think of it as edible storytelling, with each dish a chapter full of colour, flavour, and a wink of warmth. Our lunch and dinner menus are a playful parade of the season: velvety pumpkin soup that hugs you from the inside, a beet salad bursting with autumn jewel tones, and a tahini salmon bowl that\u2019s bold. Classics get a cheeky twist \u2014 fried chicken burger? Yes, please. Piri piri chicken? Bring on the heat. Seared trout? Done to perfection. And just when you think it\u2019s over, a curated cheese board arrives \u2014 the perfect encore of artisanal cheeses paired with preserves that taste like The County itself. Each plate speaks \u2014 of what grows here and the hands that make it possible. Countylicious is your invitation to taste those stories, and there\u2019s no better stage for the show than Drake Devonshire. Countylicious is about celebrating everything that makes Prince Edward County special \u2014 the season, the produce, and the people who bring it to life,\u201d says Executive Chef Amanda Ray. \u201cFor this menu, I wanted to capture the comfort of autumn with dishes that tell a story. Each plate is inspired by the harvest, crafted with care, and designed to connect diners to the heart of The County. So, pull up a chair. Take part in the story. Make Drake Devonshire your Countylicious destination this season. Reserve your table now \u2014 your tastebuds will thank you.
