At the helm is Executive Chef Amanda Ray, whose 20+ years in some of Canada\u2019s most respected kitchens have shaped a culinary perspective rooted in quality, care, and creativity.\u00a0 From her early days with Oliver &amp; Bonacini Hospitality \u2014 including roles at Canoe, Auberge du Pommier, and Biff\u2019s Bistro \u2014 to cooking rustic Proven\u00e7al cuisine in the south of France and leading the culinary program at Montreal\u2019s Le Mount Stephen Hotel + Bar George, Amanda brings a wealth of experience to the County. Now based in Prince Edward County, she\u2019s crafting dishes that reflect the region\u2019s bounty while honouring timeless technique and presentation.\u00a0 This summer\u2019s menu is a curated collection of elevated comfort \u2014 showcasing the best of what\u2019s in season, with a focus on freshness, flavour, and artistry on the plate.\u00a0 We caught up with Amanda to hear what\u2019s inspiring her in the kitchen, and what you can expect when you join us lakeside. Read more below.\u00a0 What was your vision for the new menu at Drake Devonshire? It\u2019s all about thoughtful execution. Every dish has a purpose \u2014 we\u2019re balancing texture, flavour, and presentation, while still keeping things approachable. We\u2019re proud to source locally and lean into seasonal ingredients, but the real focus is on quality. There\u2019s a quiet confidence to the new menu \u2014 it feels refined, but relaxed.\u00a0 Any dishes that really capture that spirit? The albacore tuna is a standout \u2014 fresh and clean, served with ponzu, olives, capers, and burnt sesame rice chips. It\u2019s playful, but polished. And the pea + asparagus soup is very much a taste of spring \u2014 vibrant and delicate, finished with mint and microgreens. Small touches make a big difference.\u00a0 The Devonshire is known for its balance of comfort and creativity. How do you honour that in the food? We\u2019ve kept that balance top of mind. Guests return for certain classics, and we respect that. But there\u2019s room to refine. Whether it\u2019s the Drake burger or our London-style fish + chips, it\u2019s about thoughtful sourcing, great technique, and strong presentation. Nothing on the plate is there by accident.\u00a0 What\u2019s one dish that really exemplifies your approach right now? The 8oz hanger steak is a personal favourite. It\u2019s tender, flavourful, and served with hand-cut fries \u2014 simple but done properly. We offer it with a choice of red wine jus, truffle jus, or chimichurri. It\u2019s elevated without being overthought. That\u2019s the kind of dish I love sending out of the kitchen.\u00a0 You\u2019ve cooked in so many incredible kitchens. What\u2019s special about working here in Prince Edward County? There\u2019s a genuine connection between the land and the food here. You meet the growers. You feel the seasons shift. And there\u2019s something calming about the lake and the light \u2014 it makes its way into how we cook, how we host. It\u2019s a special place to be a chef.\u00a0 Dinner, Refined. Welcome to The County. From lakeside snacks to elegant mains, the new menu at Drake Devonshire invites you to slow down and savour the season. Whether you\u2019re joining us for a long weekend or simply dinner with a view, expect fresh ingredients, beautifully balanced flavours, and a warm County welcome.\u00a0 Pro tip: start with the burrata, finish with the hanger steak, and let the lake do the rest.\u00a0"}},"categories":[56,60],"class_list":["post-2558","article","type-article","status-publish","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-food-bev","category-people"],"acf":[],"lang":"en","translations":{"en":2558},"pll_sync_post":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/thedrake.ca\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/article\/2558","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/thedrake.ca\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/article"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/thedrake.ca\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/article"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thedrake.ca\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2561"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/thedrake.ca\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2558"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thedrake.ca\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2558"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
