When Nigel \u201cLegin\u201d John took a family trip to Trinidad in 1996, he was just a teenager looking for a crochet cap to hold his dreadlocks\u2014but what he found was a way of life. It was here that Legin\u2019s cousin introduced him to a Rastafarian crochet artist named Sean. Rather than just sell him a hat, Sean chose to mentor Legin, showing him both how to crochet and how to make a living out of it. \u201cI got to see that crochet isn\u2019t just creative, but that it can make you the source of creating things,\u201d says Legin. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to go out and buy everything, and that really stood out to me.\u201d \u201c When you use crochet therapeutically, wholeheartedly, the mind is clear and the yarn just moves.\u201d -LEGIN Legin immersed himself in the craft as soon as he landed back in Toronto, picking up skeins of yarn from Romni Wools and whipping up caps for his friends. His new hobby transformed into a business, as Legin and his now crochet-converted friends set up shop to sell their wares at local flea markets. The group was guided by the ethos of providing quality handmade crochet items\u2014made with love and natural fibres\u2014to a growing clientele, and thus, Legin Knits was born. In the decades since, Legin Knits has expanded beyond retail to include workshops that highlight crochet\u2019s therapeutic and meditative aspects. \u201cWhen you use crochet therapeutically, wholeheartedly, the mind is clear and the yarn just moves,\u201d says Legin. \u201cThat\u2019s the part that I teach\u2014how to free your mind and just embrace the moment.\u201d It\u2019s a message that resonates deeply with his workshops\u2019 diverse participants\u2014particularly frontline hospital workers seeking relief from their daily stresses. At the Drake Hotel, Legin hosts a series of public events like the \u201cArt of Crochet and Jazz,\u201d where participants can pick up the hooks in a social and supportive environment. Carrying the torch from his former mentor Sean, Legin encourages his students to ask questions, explore new horizons, reclaim their narratives, and discover their own potential\u2014a powerful transformation that unfolds in the realm of crochet. \u201cI\u2019m always coming from the roots and culture perspective when I teach crochet,\u201d explains Legin. \u201cIt\u2019s about knowing your past so that you can be present. Then, it\u2019s about embracing the present so that you can flow with the future.\u201d The Art of Crochet happens monthly at The Drake Lounge, head to the What&#8217;s On to get your tickets."}},"categories":[1,50,58,60],"class_list":["post-2131","article","type-article","status-publish","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-art","category-community","category-music","category-people"],"acf":[],"lang":"en","translations":{"en":2131},"pll_sync_post":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/thedrake.ca\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/article\/2131","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/thedrake.ca\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/article"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/thedrake.ca\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/article"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thedrake.ca\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2132"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/thedrake.ca\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2131"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thedrake.ca\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2131"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
