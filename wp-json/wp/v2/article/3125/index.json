Miss Mo\u00e7o [mo-su], of Canada\u2019s Drag Race fame, has garnered quite an entourage. For the past 9+ years, drag brunch enthusiasts have flocked to various venues to be roused by the brunch scene queen. Outside of Drag, Mo\u00e7o (he\/him), can be found behind the camera as a photographer where his deep love for travel, endless pursuit of self discovery and innate desire to explore human connection are the muses of his work."}},"categories":[54,56,60],"class_list":["post-3125","article","type-article","status-publish","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-drake-partners","category-food-bev","category-people"],"acf":[],"lang":"en","translations":{"en":3125},"pll_sync_post":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/thedrake.ca\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/article\/3125","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/thedrake.ca\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/article"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/thedrake.ca\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/article"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thedrake.ca\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/3126"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/thedrake.ca\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3125"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thedrake.ca\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3125"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
